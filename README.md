# GRDN

All i did in this branch was: set up routes and tabs for react navigation + testing mapview and expo location. Used stack navigator and declared routes + params.

Petitition to rename the app PLS. Used namelix.com and i liked the following suggestions: farmgrow, lawnable, cropbase

Also i installed the following packages, look them up. I commented how i used them in the files using them (list of files below this list):
> react-native-svg
> react-native-svg-transformer
> expo-location
> react-native-maps //expo map view
> react-redux
> redux-thunk
> redux-persist
> @react-native-async-storage/async-storage // needed
